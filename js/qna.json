		{"Question": "What is the MercadoLibre Cross-Border Trade Program?","Answer": "The MercadoLibre Cross-Border Trade Program (aka MELI CBT) aims to help international merchants to sell on MercadoLibre throughout Latin America."},
		{"Question": "What countries are enabled for MELI CBT?","Answer": "Currently cross-border trade (CBT) is enabled in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile. In a few months, we will be enabling additional countries. Our goal is to enable CBT in all of the 13 countries where MercadoLibre operates."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Getting Started", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How do I register to be part of MELI CBT?","Answer": "Use our CBT registration flow. During the registration flow, you will be asked to provide basic information such as e-mail, address, desired display name, etc., as well as tax ID and banking information for withdrawals. You will also be required to accept MELI CBT platform's Terms & Conditions."},
		{"Question": "Are there any requirements for selling on MercadoLibre?","Answer": "No. Any international seller can register to sell on MercadoLibre through the MELI CBT platform. However, we do place certain limits on new accounts, and our current tools and systems are geared toward higher-volume sellers as opposed to individuals."},
		{"Question": "What countries do you support? Can I become a seller if I am selling from China or Germany?","Answer": "Yes. The program is open to sellers worldwide."},
		{"Question": "I am a seller in Brazil/Mexico/Argentina, and I already sell on MercadoLibre. Can I participate in the Cross-Border Trade Program?","Answer": "Yes! For example, if you are a seller in Brazil and want to list in Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, you can register a Cross-Border Trade account and upload your inventory to these countries using the MELI CBT platform."},
		{"Question": "Do I need to create accounts in every MercadoLibre country such as Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia?","Answer": "No. When you register as a CBT seller, our system will automatically create multiple local accounts for each country on your behalf and link these accounts."},
		{"Question": "Can I get an account manager?","Answer": "Our Cross-Border Trade Program (MELI CBT) is new, and we do not have an account management team at this time."},
		{"Question": "Is there a number I can call to ask a few questions?","Answer": "We don't have phone support, but feel free to e-mail us."},
		{"Question": "What is the display name?","Answer": "It is your username for the MELI CBT platform. When we create multiple accounts (one per country) on your behalf, we try to match that username as closely as possible."},
		{"Question": "Can I upload my company logo to be displayed in my listings?","Answer": "Yes, you can upload a logo to be displayed in your listings. To upload the logo, log in to your MELI CBT account (Merchant Portal) and go to listing template from the left navigation menu. There you will be able to edit or add a logo. We accept the following formats: jpg, jpeg, and png. Your logo will be resized to fit the template which has max width = 300px and max length = 200px."},
		{"Question": "I registered, but I am getting an error message that says: <i>Attention Needed!!  Account has not been activated.  Please contact MELI CBT.</i>","Answer": "This happened because we still need to do some account setup for you. Please e-mail us to get this resolved."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Loading Products", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How do I load my products in MercadoLibre?","Answer": "Today, there are three ways for you to upload your catalog to MercadoLibre CBT:<ul><li>Third party software providers such as Channel Advisor or Channel Sale. These providers are fully integrated with MELI CBT.</li><li>FileSwap: We have a file-based system where you can upload inventory files (csv) and download orders from MercadoLibre CBT.</li><li>APIs: If you have technical staff and want to integrate directly using our APIs, this is the best solution for you.</li></ul>"},
		{"Question": "What products sell well in MercadoLibre?","Answer": "MercadoLibre is a broad e-commerce site, and our coverage spans across multiple categories. Our top categories are Electronics and Accessories, Cell Phones, Fashion, Home and Garden, Car Accessories, and Sporting Goods. Our experience also shows us that lower Average Selling Price (ASP) items (<USD$50) and lighter items (<2lb) convert faster and can help new sellers build their reputation."},
		{"Question": "Can I provide my content in English?","Answer": "Yes, you can provide your content in English. We will automatically translate your title and description to Portuguese (Brazil) and Spanish (rest of Latin America). Keep in mind that the automatic translation is not perfect and will not be optimized for search. We strongly recommend sellers who can translate their content to do so to help conversion."},
		{"Question": "What if I have content translated into Spanish or Portuguese? Can I use those?","Answer": "Yes, absolutely. In fact, our experience shows that manually translated content performs much better than automatically translated content (search and conversion)."},
		{"Question": "What categories should I use?","Answer": "You should use the MercadoLibre CBT (MELI CBT) category structure. You have to list your items using the lowest-level category (leaf level) in the category structure. A leaf-level category is one that has no children or subcategories."},
		{"Question": "Do you support US sizes?","Answer": "Yes, you will list using US sizes."},
		{"Question": "How do sizes work?","Answer": "US sizes are mapped to local sizes. Local sizes vary by country. For example, shoe sizes in Brazil are different from shoe sizes in Mexico, which are different from the ones used in Colombia. When you list a shoe using a US shoe size, our system shows buyers the local size."},
		{"Question": "Can I request a size be added?","Answer": "Yes. However, in many cases, we will not be able to add specific sizes. For example, if a size does not match any local size that a buyer would understand, we will not be able to add it at this time. We are working on a more flexible system for international sizes, but it will take us a while to get this done."},
		{"Question": "I am getting the following error: Error from MercadoLibre CBT: (10080 Reached product maximum limit). What does it mean?","Answer": "It means that you reached the maximum number of SKUs you can list at this time. When you first start selling, we ask you to list no more than 100 SKUs so we can check that the data are accurate. Once that verification has been done, the initial limit will be raised, and you can list more SKUs. Please contact us if you require assistance raising this limit."},
		{"Question": "Is there a limit to number of SKUs I can list on MELI?","Answer": "No, there is no limit to the number of SKUs you can list. However, when an account has recently been opened, we do temporarily limit it to no more than 100 products until we verify data. Once that initial data verification is done, you will be able to list more."},
		{"Question": "How does MELI calculate the SKU count?","Answer": "One SKU is a stock-keeping unit. If, for example you have 10 different products, they will have 10 different SKUs (listed 10 times in each country: 10 in Brazil, 10 in Chile, 10 in Colombia, 10 in Mexico). Also, if your product has 4 variations (such as a tennis shoe for which you have sizes 6, 7, 8 and 9), those are 4 different SKUs."},
		{"Question": "I don't see the same number of listings in Mexico and in Brazil. What happened?","Answer": "It is possible. In fact, that will happen in most cases. Possible causes:<ul><li>You are listing in a category where variations are supported in Brazil, but not in Mexico. For this case, for the same SKU you will see one listing in Brazil and four in Mexico. The listing in Brazil will show 4 available sizes in the drop-down menu, and in Mexico, each listing will show one size.</li><li>Certain products are blocked by certain countries. For example, supplements can't be sold in Mexico, so the system will not list it in that market.</li></ul>"},
		{"Question": "I listed my items, but I can't see them after submitting them. What is happening?","Answer": "If you provided the content in English, we will run translation using machine translation first. This process takes some timeâ€š usually a few hours. After it is done, you will be able to see the products live by going to Merchant Portal > Listings."},
		{"Question": "I am getting an error: <i>Field Category value 9981 is not allowed.</i> What does it mean?","Answer": "Most likely you are trying to use a category that is not a leaf category. To fix it, go to our category page, and make sure you select the lowest-level category (leaf level) in the category structure. A leaf-level category is one that has no children or subcategories."},
		{"Question": "Why are categories important in MercadoLibre?","Answer": "Our search engine relies on our categories to optimize search results. If a listing is not categorized correctly, the chance of being found in a user's search is significantly diminished. For this reason, we recommend CBT sellers pay special attention to item categorization and avoid generic <i>other</i> categories."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Product Prices", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "Will my products be displayed in US dollars?","Answer": "No, your products will be shown in the local currency. (e.g., Brazilian reais in Brazil, Mexican pesos in Mexico, etc.)."},
		{"Question": "Will I receive payments in dollars or local currency?","Answer": "You will receive payments in US dollars."},
		{"Question": "Can I receive payments in a country other than the US?","Answer": "Yes, if you use a service that provides you with a US bank account. To this end, we have partnered with Payoneer."},
		{"Question": "How do you calculate price to end user?","Answer": "We start with your price in dollars, add all costs associated with the sale, including MercadoLibre fees, and multiply by our daily conversion rate: (your price +  domestic shipping (if any) + international shipping + customs/taxes (if any) + (MercadoLibre fees) * foreign exchange conversion rate"},
		{"Question": "How do I know if my products are competitive?","Answer": "We suggest you look at your listings in local markets and perform similar searches to see if you find similar products being sold by local sellers."},
		{"Question": "What does <i>12x sem juros</i> mean?","Answer": "It is payments by installments. It is typical in Latin America for e-commerce companies to offer the option for buyers to finance their purchases in installments."},
		{"Question": "When a buyer pays in installments (12x sem juros), will I receive the money in installments?","Answer": "No, you will receive the money up front. The financing cost is already included in the MercadoLibre fee."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Answering Buyers' Questions", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How do I answer questions from buyers?","Answer": "Buyers will ask pre-sale questions in the local language (Portuguese or Spanish) in their countries. You can view these questions, in the local language and English, in your merchant hub under Questions > Unanswered Questions. You can use this interface to answer the questions either in the local language or English (machine translated)."},
		{"Question": "Can I answer questions in English?","Answer": "Yes. You can answer questions in English. The answer will be automatically translated and sent to the buyer."},
		{"Question": "Can I answer questions in Spanish or Portuguese?","Answer": "Yes, you can answer buyers directly in Spanish or Portuguese. You can also set up the default language by clicking on the preferences link next to the questions search box."},
		{"Question": "Can I answer questions directly from my customer relationship management (CRM) system?","Answer": "At this time, you can view questions from your CRM system, but you are required to log in to the MELI CBT Merchant Portal to answer questions."},
		{"Question": "Do you notify me when I receive a question?","Answer": "Yes, you are notified when you receive a question from a buyer. The notification goes to the e-mail you added when you created your MELI CBT account. If you wish to change that e-mail address, you can do so on the Merchant Portal under Account > Notifications."},
		{"Question": "Can I block questions from buyers?","Answer": "While we strongly advise against it, you can block questions from buyers. We believe that answering pre-sale questions can significantly increase your chances of success on the platform. If you are unable to answer pre-sale questions, please contact us and we can block buyers from asking you pre-sale questions."},
		{"Question": "If I have a person who will handle questions, but I don't want this person to have full access to my account, how do I set it up?","Answer": "Go to Merchant Portal and log in with your main (admin) account. Once you are logged in, go to My Account > User Management and add a user. You will be able to define what this user is capable of accessing during the user setup."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Getting Orders", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How do I view my orders?","Answer": "You can view your orders by logging into the MELI CBT Merchant Portal. Click on Sales > Orders. If you are using Channel Advisor or any other third-party tool that integrates with MELI CBT, you should be able to see your orders in that interface as well."},
		{"Question": "Can I get a file with my orders?","Answer": "Yes. You can download your orders through the MELI CBT Merchant Portal. Go to Sales > Orders and you should see a download link on the top right corner of that section. You can select the date range you desire."},
		{"Question": "I received an order for a product that is out of stock. What should I do?","Answer": "Please cancel the order and refund the buyer. You can cancel the order directly from the MELI CBT Merchant Portal. Find the order (under Sales > Order) and click on <i>Cancel Order</i> from the menu next to the order data. The buyer will still be able to leave feedback for that order. Note that cancelling many orders might significantly impact your reputation."},
		{"Question": "Do you have an FTP location where I can get files?","Answer": "No, FTP is not available at this time."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Shipping", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "What are my options for shipping products?","Answer": "There are three ways you can ship your products to MercadoLibre buyers: <ul><li>You can ship your products to our local warehouse(s) in the United States. We will take care of the international portion of shipment and deliver the item to buyers. We currently operate from two warehouses, one in Florida (for Brazil, Chile, and Colombia) and another in Texas (for Mexico). This option is only available for US sellers.</li><li>You can ship your products directly to buyers using your shipment company of choice. This option is available to all sellers. Under this option, you can ship using a local postal service, such as USPS, Hong Kong Post, or Royal Mail or a courier service such as UPS or FEDEX.  Local postal services do not require prepayment of taxes (DDU method), whereas couriers usually request a prepayment of taxes (DDP method). We have more details about DDU and DDP below. </li><li>You can use DHL to ship items directly to buyers. We have preferred DHL rates, and you will be using our DHL account to ship items directly to buyers.</li></ul>"},
		{"Question": "What is DDP?","Answer": "DDP stands for delivery duty paid. It is a method in which the buyer prepays for customs, and import duties are handled prior to the arrival of the item in a country. This service is often provided by couriers such as DHL, FEDEX, and so on. This service is more convenient to buyers because it's fast and easily trackable. However, there are two disadvantages: the shipping price is significantly higher, and buyers have to prepay taxes."},
		{"Question": "What is DDU?","Answer": "DDU stands for delivery duty unpaid. It is a service available on both EMS postal services and couriers.  In the DDU scenario, the buyer does not prepay customs and will pay taxes, if required, when the item reaches his or her country. Normally, DDU is associated with parcel or EMS services. The EMS DDU shipping price is a top choice for Latin American buyers for two reasons: the low shipping price and the chance that the product will pass through customs without taxes being paid.  However, EMS DDU's service is not up to par with that of couriers because packages usually take longer to arrive and have less-trackable events."},
		{"Question": "How much does it cost me to ship Courier/DDP using MercadoLibre's US warehouse?","Answer": "You are responsible to ship the product to our US warehouse and don't have to pay anything for international shipping.  We will add the cost of international shipping and taxes to the product price displayed to buyers. Because the buyer will be paying for shipping and customs up front, choosing DDP might affect your competitiveness. In general, DDP shipping method is done using multiple carriers, and shipping prices vary depending on the country of destination. For example, a 1 lb. package costs $16 to Brazil and $11 to Mexico."},
		{"Question": "How much will it cost for me to ship an item Postal/DDU?","Answer": "Under the Postal/DDU method, you are responsible for international shipping costs, and the cost will depend on the negotiation you have with your logistics provider. Some logistics providers can be extremely competitive with EMS postal pricing."},
		{"Question": "Can I ship my items directly?","Answer": "Yes, you can ship your items directly. If you chose EMS postal as your preferred method of shipping, you will be responsible for shipping the item directly to the buyer using your parcel service of choice. You can also ship directly using our DHL integration (DDP) or your own courier/DDP integration if you have one."},
		{"Question": "Do you provide warehousing services?","Answer": "Not at this time."},
		{"Question": "How long does it take to deliver the product in Latin America?","Answer": "<ul><li> From MercadoLibre's US warehouse: 5 - 7 days (once the product arrives at the warehouse). </li><li> Using MercadoLibre's DHL: 5 - 7 days.</li><li> Direct shipping with EMS Parcel: between 20 - 40 days. </li></ul>"},
		{"Question": "I am a seller in Asia. Can I ship to your warehouse in the United States?","Answer": "If your products are in the United States (e.g., at a third-party logistics warehouse), you are welcome to ship to our local warehouse in the United States. Keep in mind that our warehouse is just a pass-through warehouse, and we don't hold merchandise for more than one day."},
		{"Question": "I am a seller in Asia. Can I ship directly to buyers?","Answer": "Yes, absolutely. This is what buyers ask for because it is the least expensive option."},
		{"Question": "Do you have a warehouse in Asia?","Answer": "No, we currently do not have a warehouse in Asia."},
		{"Question": "I am a seller in Europe. What are my options for shipping products?","Answer": "You can ship directly using your EMS or courier of choice. You can also use our DHL account to ship directly to buyers. We are working on an EU warehouse solution similar to the local warehouse option we have in the United States."},
		{"Question": "Can the buyer select if she wants DDU or DDP?","Answer": "No, this is a choice you have to make as a seller when listing the product."},
		{"Question": "How does the buyer see DDU or DDP?","Answer": "In DDP listings, we clearly indicate that import taxes are included, and we also show a reduced delivery time. In DDU listings, we display a longer lead time for delivery and indicate that buyers are responsible to pay taxes, if required."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Reputation", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How does the MELI reputation system work?","Answer": "Buyers can leave positive, neutral, or negative feedback on their purchases. Sellers can also leave feedback to buyers (positive, neutral, or negative). If a purchase was not completed, buyers can only leave neutral or negative feedback. Feedback is hidden until both parties have given feedback. Your reputation on MercadoLibre will have a significant impact on the search rankings of your items."},
		{"Question": "How long does it take to build a reputation?","Answer": "Our experience shows that it can take several months for a CBT merchant to be at its full potential."},
		{"Question": "How can I leave feedback to a buyer?","Answer": "Currently, you can only automate feedback on Merchant Portal. To automate your feedback, go to Merchant Portal then go to the My Account > Feedback template. You can automate leaving positive feedback and customize your feedback message in Portuguese and Spanish."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Returns, Refunds, Disputes", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How should I handle returns?","Answer": "Returns are the seller's responsibility. You may choose the return policy you prefer."},
		{"Question": "Am I supposed to abide by a particular return policy?","Answer": "No. Sellers on MercadoLibre are not required to follow a specific return policy. However, your reputation can significantly help or hinder your search standings. Therefore, we advise that sellers be generous with their return policies so they can keep their reputation levels up."},
		{"Question": "How can I answer a dispute?","Answer": "Buyers can open disputes when items are not delivered or when they are not satisfied with their purchases (e.g., a broken item, an item not as described, etc.). Currently, we are helping CBT merchants handle these disputes. Soon we will enable disputes in My Account, and sellers will take over the responsibility for disputes."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Commercial", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How much do you charge?","Answer": "If you send us your product with the price of USD$100 and it sells, you will receive $100. We add MercadoLibre fees to the final price the buyer sees locally. The standard fees for CBT are 15% final value fees with no listing fees."},
		{"Question": "Is there any fee to list items?","Answer": "No, under the Cross-Border Trade Program, there are no fees to list items."},
		{"Question": "Is there a fee to sell items?","Answer": "We add 15% to the price you send us. So, if you list your product for $100 and it sells, you will receive $100 from us."},
		{"Question": "If I tell you my product costs $100, how much do I receive?","Answer": "You will receive $100. The buyer will be shown prices in local currency that reflect this price along with any associated extra costs related to the sale of that item (e.g., international shipping, MELI fees, etc.)."},
		{"Question": "When will I be paid?","Answer": "You will be paid every 15 days during the week of the 1st and 16th of each month."},
		{"Question": "Do I need to have a bank account in Brazil/Mexico/Chile/Colombia?","Answer": "No. You will be paid in a US bank account or your Payoneer account."},
		{"Question": "How am I paid?","Answer": "We will transfer the money to the account you set up with us."},
		{"Question": "Can I add a bank account in China or Hong Kong?","Answer": "If you do not have a US bank account, please sign up with Payoneer and use the US bank account provided by them. The Payoneer account allows you to transfer your funds directly to your local bank account."},
		{"Question": "Can I view the sales for which I am receiving payment?","Answer": "We will e-mail you a file with the sales data every time a payment is made. In the future, this file will be available for you in Merchant Portal"},
		{"Question": "How do I change my bank account information in Merchant Portal?","Answer": "You can add your bank account information at any time during registration or by logging into your account and going to My Account > Profile > Bank Account. If you wish to change your bank account information after payments have been made, please contact us."}]},
	{ "Topic": "Strategy", "QuestionAnswers": [
		{"Question": "How can I sell more in MercadoLibre?","Answer": "There are several things you can do to improve your sales in MercadoLibre. Here are some strategies that have worked for some of our merchants:<ul><li>List more items: Having thousands of items increases your chances of being found by buyers. Besides, some items are more attractive than others in different countries. The challenge is to figure out which ones. The best strategy we have seen is when sellers try to maximize the number of SKUs they have available in the marketplace.</li><li>Pay special attention to product titles: while we provide automatic translations for titles, the automatic translation is not optimized for search and can sometimes scare off buyers. If you have the resources to double check automatically translated titles and/or can pay for manual translations of titles, your chances of conversion will increase.</li><li>Categorize your items correctly: Categories are very important for MELI. Products in the correct category have a much higher chance of being found. We understand that selecting categories is a painful and labor-intensive process, but you will be much better off by slowly increasing your number of listings and providing a good-quality category than by uploading many items in <i>other</i> categories that will never be found by potential buyers.</li><li>Include key information about your products in the appropriate fields such as product type, brand, model, and UPC/EAN. These fields are used in local marketing campaigns and can help increase exposure for your items in a local search.</li><li>Answer pre-sales questions fast: Culturally, Latin American buyers like to ask questions before they buy. Local successful sellers respond to questions within minutes. The faster you can respond to questions, the higher the chance of conversion. </li><li>Add Spanish and/or Portuguese speaker resources to your staff: While we provide you with tools to translate content, title, and questions, if you are able to add resources who can write in Portuguese or Spanish, the quality of your questions and answers can increase significantly, along with your chances of conversion.</li><li>Find the optimal shipping/selling method (EMS Postal DDU vs. Courier DDP).</li><li>Lower your prices: Latin American buyers are very price sensitive. Also, they would probably not buy a very expensive item initially from a seller with a low or unknown reputation. Our suggestion is to always start with lower prices, drive sales, improve your feedback, and only then start adding higher average selling price (ASP) items.</li><li>Drive your first sale: A product sale significantly increases the listing relevance in search results. It is a good indication that buyers like the item.  To make your listings more relevant, it's crucial to drive the first sale.  Your items with 1+ sales will have a significantly higher chance of being found than your items with 0 sales. Therefore, it is important to launch products with the lowest possible price and, if necessary, raise the item price after a few sales.</li><li>Patience: Don't forget that while you might have a long history in other channels, when you start in MercadoLibre, you are a brand new merchant. It takes time to build a reputation and for buyers to trust you in our company. </li></ul>"}]}]
